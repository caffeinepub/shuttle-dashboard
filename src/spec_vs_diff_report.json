  "summary": "REQ-13 and REQ-14 appear implemented via HTML datalist-based autocomplete for Center Name and per-coach Center fields, with options derived from already-fetched dashboards data and still allowing free typing. REQ-15 (automatic option updates after save/delete via React Query refresh) is only partially evidenced: options are recomputed from `dashboards`, but the diff summary does not show whether save/delete mutations reliably trigger refetch/invalidation so the options update after mutations.",

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure the selectable options lists for Center Name and Coach Center automatically reflect newly saved or deleted records after React Query refreshes dashboard data.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `centerOptions` is derived from `dashboards` and thus would update when `dashboards` changes, but the provided diff summary does not include evidence that the save/delete React Query mutations invalidate/refetch `useAllDashboards()` so that `dashboards` actually updates after saving or deleting records (especially needed for removing an option after deleting the last record for a center).",
